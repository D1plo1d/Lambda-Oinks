Yay, it's a blog!

How was Lambda Oinks made?
------
Of course, being me, I decided to opt out of an easy, ready-made blogging platform, like [Medium] or [WordPress].

Here are some of the general topics I intend to cover. It will be interesting to see how this changes:

* math and neural networks
* being female in a community with a highly skewed gender ratio
* thoughts on how to learn independently (I've been out of school since 10th grade)
* being an emancipated minor
