I'm not a programmer.

At least, I don't consider myself to be one. And yet I made this blogging platform. 

To be clear, I also don't consider myself to be a coder or developer or hacker; this isn't about the semantics. It runs deeper than that. I've used Python, Haskell and JavaScript for various programs, from fun Project Euler problems to basic software for astronomical research. But when someone asks me if I can program (as someone inevitably does, here in the Bay Area), I answer, "no." 

Friends have told me that I do know how to program, and that's different from being a good or experienced programmer. But I still feel uneasy about it. 

To assuage my lack of self-esteem, 


Mostly, I just wanted to get my hands dirty with a project. I had sorta-kinda-maybe been thinking about starting a blog for a while, but never had enough motivation to do so.
