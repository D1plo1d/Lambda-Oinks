===============================
Ideas for topics to post about:

* technical posts on neural nets and/or math
* being female in a community with a highly skewed gender ratio
* thoughts on how to learn independently 
* how I emancipated and left home (with my parents not realizing I was out of the city until weeks later)
     * issues with being under 18 and not being treated as a real person by lots of bureaucratic things 
     * issues with not being in high school
     * what it's like being financially independent at 17 and living on as little money as possible
* what it was like being religiously Jewish vs. now
* adventures I'm having - just like what my daily life is like now, and how that contrasts to what it is like for many other high school seniors and how I'm learning way more
* having fibromylagia and what that's like since it's an "invisible disease"
